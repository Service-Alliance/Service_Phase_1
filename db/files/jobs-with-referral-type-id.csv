One portion of our carpeted area may have suffered some water damage from an overflowing sewage pump more than a year ago; we would need you to evaluate that area to determine if there is any detectable moisture remaining. Depending upon your findings, we may wish to have the padding in that area replaced. We definitely want the entire 495 sq. ft. area to be disinfected with Microban and thoroughly cleaned and dried. Furniture moving will not be necessary. The space includes two staircases and two Lolly columns. Can you offer this combination of services?
